# Paper-a-Day

In order to increase my knowledge of different fields and my abilities to read and synthesize papers, I have created this repository. Everyday I will upload 1 paper (from any number of fields) and a short write up on it, containing a summary and whatever thoughts on it I might have. Each of the folders in this repo will be one major field (e.g. Machine Learning) which may have subfields (e.g. Computer Vision). Below is the fields/subfields and the associated papers and thoughts. Note that although there may be famous papers in here, my goal is not just to read the famous papers from a field (e.g. like the list found [here](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html)). Also I will only read peer-reviewed papers, as the reliance on unpublished Arxiv papers is something I see as a severe problem (especially in the ML community).
