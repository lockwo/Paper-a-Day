# Paper-a-Day 

In order to increase my knowledge of different fields and my abilities to read and synthesize papers, I have created this repository. Everyday I will upload 1 paper (from any number of fields) and a short write up on it, containing whatever thoughts on it I might have. Each of the folders in this repo will be one major field (e.g. Machine Learning) which may have subfields (e.g. Computer Vision). Below is the fields/subfields and the associated papers and thoughts. Note that although there may be famous papers in here, my goal is not just to read the famous papers from a field. Previously I would only read peer reviewed work, and while I still stand by those principles, I have been worn down by the necessity of reading preprints in order to stay current in the rapidly moving fields.
